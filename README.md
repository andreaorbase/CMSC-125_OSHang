🔵 The system will check if the letter is in the word. 
  🟩 If it is not, the virtual keyboard will update and the letter will change to red. Number of attempts will decrement and an error message appears, simulating a gradual "hang"
  🟩 If it is, the virtual keyboard will update and the letter will change to green and all the instance of the letter in the word will appear
